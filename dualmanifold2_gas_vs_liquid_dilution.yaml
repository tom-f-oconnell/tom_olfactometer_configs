settings:
  # The parameters under this key are for specifying the timing of
  # individual trials (each with a single pulse from the valve(s)).
  # All trials will share this timing.
  # All of these parameters are in units of microseconds.
  timing:
    # Baseline period.

    # How long the valve(s) will actually be delivering odor for.
    pulse_us: 1000000

    # Delay before next trial.
    # NOTE: the time from offset of the pulse to the onset of the
    # next trial (if there is one) will be:
    # (post_pulse_us + pre_pulse_us)

# Example trial structure with 4 trials. If your microcontroller 
# has pin 13 connected to the builtin LED (as Arduino Unos and 
# Megas do), running this config will flash that LED once per trial 
# (for 1s each time).
pin_sequence:
  # The rows in this bulleted list happen one after the other.
  # If the 'timing' key is specified above, each row
  # (i.e. "- pins: ...") will take
  # (pre_pulse_us + pulse_us + post_pulse_us) microseconds.
  pin_groups:
  # The pins listed in each of these rows will all be concurrently 
  # switched ONCE (LOW for pre_pulse_us -> HIGH for pulse_us ->
  # LOW for post_pulse_us)

# TODO may be easier to be clear on achievable precision if we require inputs to
# be strings? or prevent parser from converting to numbers? or just figure out
# intended precision somehow (always possible?)?
# TODO allow specifying offset before trial when flow should be changed?
# (idk... cause would i want it to overlap w/ last trial or add time?)

# Planning to use:
# COM13=high flow
# 
# COM14=group2 manifold (45-49, 50 balance)
#  - This manifold is closer and so will stay connected in single manifold case.
#
# COM15=group1 manifold (37-41, 42 balance)
