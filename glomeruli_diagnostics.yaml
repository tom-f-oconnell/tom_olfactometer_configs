# Notes on performance of this panel in particular flies:
# 2021-05-11/2:
# - t2h lights up ~DL5, but maybe weirdly south
#
# - MS does light up something arguably lateral to "DL5", but again it's surprisingly
#   close to bottom of each plane image it's in. maybe just implies an extreme head
#   angle? also something ~DM4 seems also included, an in next (2but)
