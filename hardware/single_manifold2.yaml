# TODO TODO probably rewire (mine AND remy's second i've been using) so that
# first 8 valves (including one balance, so probably have that first) are on one
# DB9, so that i can have the most valves when reconfiguring to use two DB9s
# from different manifolds

# All digital pins 37-52 (inclusive) are connected up until the valve-side
# DB9 breakout boards, which only have the first 6 pins connected to valves
# at each breakout board, so that the 12 valves on the manifold get divided
# evenly between the two breakout boards.
# You may wire other 24v valves into the unconnected pins on the valve-side
# breakouts, and then the pin numbers in 37-52 not mentioned here can be used to
# drive them (43 & 44 for breakout 1 and 51 & 52 for breakout 2. breakout 1 has
# the yellow tape on its breakouts + the DB9 cable).
# Pin 50 is on breakout 2 as well, but it's used for the balance, so only
# referencing it under 'balance_pin' below.

# A 2-way valve that normally dumps [potentially pre-diluted in air] CO2 directly to a
# vacuum, but directs it into the odor needle manifold when switched.
# Assumed that total flow rate through this valve is equal to flowrate through any one
# of the other active odor manifolds, so that the total flow can be balanced by opening
# any of the disconnected outputs on one of the other manifolds (and closing the
# corresponding NO valve).
