# TODO rewire both of my manifolds such that one of the db9 connectors uses 8
# pins for valves (and maybe have balance be first/last pin on each?)
# rather than two db9 each handling 6 valves, so 2 manifold case can use 16
# valves (and is that the max driveable w/ 2 of the valve driving chips i'm
# using? or are they 10 channels each?)

# Top row of Remy's second manifold that I had been working with, wired into the
# yellow-tape-labelled DB9 cable to my newest (as of start of 2021) electronics
# assembly.

# Top row of the manifold that I bought and assembled fully myself. Connected to
# the DB9 cable WITHOUT the yellow tape, also connected to my newest
# electronics. If the bottom row of this manifold (also via the cable with the
# yellow tape) is connected, that configuration corresponds to
# single_manifold2.yaml.

# A 2-way valve that normally dumps [potentially pre-diluted in air] CO2 directly to a
# vacuum, but directs it into the odor needle manifold when switched.
# Assumed that total flow rate through this valve is equal to flowrate through any one
# of the other active odor manifolds, so that the total flow can be balanced by opening
# any of the disconnected outputs on one of the other manifolds (and closing the
# corresponding NO valve).
