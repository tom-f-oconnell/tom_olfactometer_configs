# Note that this does not include the balance_pin, which is handled separately.
# This is currently only used in the generator, though if any pins are
# considered reserved by the firmware on the particular hardware used, it will
# intentionally trigger an error.
# NOTE: the newer olfactometer (Remy's ~clone) I am planning on starting with
# has 1/12 valves as the normally open balance, and the valve that would be
# driven by pin 12 is currently broken, so we have 10 valves for odors
# (1 fewer if we want a solvent in *every* recording, rather than just in maybe
# the last diagnostic panel)

# This is the pin this is currently connected to, but my code doesn't yet
# support this. Currently just planning to always have the mirror allowing light
# through, during my recordings. (actually floating now b/c i couldn't resolve
# influence from partially connected olfactometer of remys when not using it)
#mirror_pin: 33

# TODO maybe also implement things like rig -> arduino version -> reserved_pins
# (& similar variable) translation, rather than having to explicitly specify for
# each rig, even though it just depends on the arduino version
