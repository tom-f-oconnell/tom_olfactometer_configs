# Example of how this works: if odors A and B are presented at all combinations of
# (-5, -4, -3), this will add (n_repeats of) solvent presentation (with the extra vials
# and their own normally closed valve per manifold) between -3 of A and -3 of B, as well
# as between (-4, -4)  and (-5, -5) (currently it's guaranteed that each increase in
# concentration of the first odor to ramp will be followed by the corresponding
# ramp for odor B). Assuming A was selected to ramp first in preceding example.
