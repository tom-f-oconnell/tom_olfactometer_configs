settings:
  # The parameters under this key are for specifying the timing of
  # individual trials (each with a single pulse from the valve(s)).

# (for 1s each time).
pin_sequence:
  # The rows in this bulleted list happen one after the other.
  # If the 'timing' key is specified above, each row
  # (i.e. "- pins: ...") will take

  pin_groups:
  # The pins listed in each of these rows will all be concurrently 
  # switched ONCE (LOW for pre_pulse_us -> HIGH for pulse_us ->
  # LOW for post_pulse_us)

# TODO may be easier to be clear on achievable precision if we require inputs to
# be strings? or prevent parser from converting to numbers? or just figure out
# intended precision somehow (always possible?)?
# TODO allow specifying offset before trial when flow should be changed?
# (idk... cause would i want it to overlap w/ last trial or add time?)
