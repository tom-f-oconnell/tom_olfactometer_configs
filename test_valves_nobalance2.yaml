# Use this, rather than test_valves.yaml to check valves by listening for

# in water.

settings:
  # The parameters under this key are for specifying the timing of
  # individual trials (each with a single pulse from the valve(s)).
  # All trials will share this timing.
  # All of these parameters are in units of microseconds.
  timing:
    # Baseline period.
    pre_pulse_us: 500000

    # How long the valve(s) will actually be delivering odor for.
    #pulse_us: 5000000
    pulse_us: 500000

    # Delay before next trial.
    # NOTE: the time from offset of the pulse to the onset of the
    # next trial (if there is one) will be:
    # (post_pulse_us + pre_pulse_us)
    post_pulse_us: 500000
